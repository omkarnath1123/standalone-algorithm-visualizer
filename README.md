**Standalone Algorithm Visualizer** is the standalone app which is build for `Mac`, `Windows` and `Linux OS` and is build on `Javascript` and [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) And yes it is an open-source and will always be. It gives you a playground to learn while you play with algorithm and its theory. It makes mathematical expression and theorm easy to understand.

> Download latest [release](https://github.com/omkarnath1123/standalone-algorithm-visualizer/releases) to run app on your local machine.

> Note: The project is still expanding. New units are added and existing ones modified from time to time.

### Uses

- this app tries coveres (adding conten) the theoretical and practical aspects of algorithms.
- movable and draggable interface make algorithms even more easier to understand.
- algorithm theorem are now more even easier to undestand.
